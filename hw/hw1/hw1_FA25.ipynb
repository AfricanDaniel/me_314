Assume that the two springs have lengths of zero when \"relaxed\", they are stretched with any positive displacement $\\Delta x > 0$, and the magnitude of the force can be computed using Hooke's law $|F| = k \\Delta x$, where $k$ is the spring constant. Furthermore, there is no friction between the blocks and the ground.\n",

You need to use Pythons's SymPy package to solve for symbolic solutions, as well as numerically evaluate your solutions for $a_1$ and $a_2$ as functions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively.

Plot the trajectories of $x(t)$ and $\\theta(t)$ versus time.\n",

This means that the function of dynamics (i.e. $f(xt)$), whose input is fed to the numerical integration and simulation functions, needs to return the first-order time derivative. This might be confusing because our solutions $\\ddot{x}(t)$ and $\\ddot{\\theta}(t)$ are second-order time derivative. The trick here is to extend the system state from $[x(t), \\theta(t)]$ to $[x(t), \\theta(t), \\dot{x}(t), \\dot{\\theta}(t)]$, thus the time derivative of the state vector becomes $[\\dot{x}(t), \\dot{\\theta}(t), \\ddot{x}(t), \\ddot{\\theta}(t)]$. Now, when you write down the system dynamics function, the third and forth elements of input vector $\\dot{x}(t)$ and $\\dot{\\theta}(t)$ can be put into the output vector directly, and we already know the rest two elements of the output vector, from our previous solution of Euler-Lagrange equations.

An example is provided below for simulating a particle falling in gravity, where the acceleration $\\ddot{x}(t) = -9.8$.*\n",

This is not required, and it's fine if you don't want to do it (you can always go back here after you're more familiar with Python and course materials).

    "However, what if we need to compute the trace of a 5-by-5 matrix instead? Then we need to rewrite the code! In our simple example, this isn't that annoying or time consuming. However, for more complicated problems it could be very annoying, especially when we find that we are basically doing the same thing every time we rewrite the code - manually adding all the diagonal elements together as well as very tedious, especially in case if there are multiple places in the code where we perform the same calculation. Thus, why don't we just write a function once, and it will handle matrices with all possible dimensions for us? The challenge is that the function doesn't know what matrix it will be provided ahead of time! One solution is to require matrix dimension as a function input (you might find this very common in lower-level programming languages like C/C++). But in Python, we have better choice - querying the dimension of your input! Here's one possible implementation:"

    "Python provides some really nice methods to tell us the dimension of the data! While the default is `len()`, given NumPy or SymPy you can also use `.shape()`. In this way, you can generalize your method through the function, and easily reuse your code later.
